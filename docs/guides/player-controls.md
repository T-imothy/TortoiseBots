# Available Bot Commands & Addon Controls

TortoiseBots provides a native, intent-driven command suite (`.bot`) that powers both the **[TortoiseBotsManager](https://github.com/Sagiroth/TortoiseBotsManager)** (`/tbm`) addon and standard in-game chat commands.

All commands require the requesting player to be an in-game character owning the target bot (same account) or a GameMaster.

## 1. Tactical Party Actions (`.bot action <intent>`)

The modern control plane operates on **player intent**. Instead of micromanaging each bot, you issue high-level tactical commands; the server resolves target scope and selects appropriate bot executors:

| Command | Target Required | What It Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `.bot action attack` | Hostile Target | Controllable party bots engage your current target immediately. |
| `.bot action interrupt` | Casting Hostile | Evaluates party bots and orders a capable bot in range with a ready interrupt (e.g. *Kick*, *Pummel*, *Earth Shock*, *Counterspell*) to interrupt the cast. |
| `.bot action stop` | None | Clears combat queues and stops current attacks. |
| `.bot action pull` | Hostile Target | Directs the party tank to pull your target with ranged attack/taunt while other bots hold damage until threat is established. |
| `.bot action pullback` | Hostile Target | Tank pulls the target and sprints back to the group's current coordinates. |
| `.bot action come` | None | All bots sprint directly to the player's exact coordinates. |
| `.bot action stay` *(or `hold`)* | None | Bots halt at their current position and hold ground. |
| `.bot action follow` | None | Bots break current movement and resume tight follow formation behind the leader. |
| `.bot action focus skull` | Enemy / None | Sets or targets the **Skull** raid icon; orders all party DPS bots to focus fire on that target. |
| `.bot action cc <mark>` | Marked Mob | Orders a capable bot (Mage *Polymorph*, Rogue *Sap*, Warlock *Seduce*, Priest *Shackle*, Druid *Hibernate*) to CC the target. |
| `.bot action aoe <on\|off>` | None | Toggles whether DPS bots cast high-damage AoE abilities (useful to toggle OFF around CC targets). |
| `.bot action ready` | None | Initiates a group ready check across all party bots. |

## 2. Roster & Lifecycle Commands

These commands manage the login, party membership, and presence of your owned bots:

| Command | Syntax | What It Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Roster Snapshot** | `.bot roster` | Returns an authoritative snapshot of all owned characters on your account and their online/party state (emits structured `TBM:ROSTER`). |
| **Login Bot** | `.bot add <Name>` | Logs in an owned character from your account as a headless bot. |
| **Logout Bot** | `.bot remove <Name>` *(or `logout`)* | Cleanly logs out an active headless bot on your account. |
| **Invite to Party** | `.bot invite <Name>` | Sends a party invite to an online bot on your account. |
| **Uninvite from Party**| `.bot uninvite <Name>` *(or `kick`)*| Removes an owned bot from your group. |
| **Summon** | `.bot summon [Name]` | Teleports your owned party bot(s) safely to your location out of combat. |

## 3. Direct Party & Movement Commands

Direct command shortcuts that operate on your targeted bot or all party bots:

| Command | Parameters | What It Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `.bot follow` | `[Name]` | Orders targeted bot (or all party bots) to follow the requester. |
| `.bot stay` | `[Name]` | Orders targeted bot (or all party bots) to stay at current location. |
| `.bot guard` | `[Name]` | Orders bot to guard its current position and engage nearby threats. |
| `.bot free` | `[Name]` | Releases bot from stay/guard back to free autonomous movement. |
| `.bot ready` | None | Checks if party bots are ready (health/mana full, buffs active). |
| `.bot attack` | `[Name]` | Orders targeted bot to attack your current hostile target. |
| `.bot pullback` | `[Name]` | Dispatches pullback maneuver on the specified bot or designated tank. |
| `.bot formation` | `<arrow\|queue\|near\|line\|circle\|shield>` | Sets the geometric follow formation around the party leader. |

## 4. Diagnostics & Inspection Commands

Commands for checking bot state, lifecycle, and fleet metrics:

| Command | Parameters | What It Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `.bot list` | None | Lists all online bots currently owned by your account (Name, lifecycle, random flag, AI status). |
| `.bot status` | `<Name>` | Displays detailed status of an owned bot: lifecycle (`starting`, `in world`, `removing`), AI attachment, active movement strategy (`follow`, `stay`, `guard`, `free`, `custom`), and owner. |
| `.bot stats` | None | Summarizes owned bot fleet: total online, random bots, and bots with active AI attached. |
| `.bot lease` | `[status]` | Reports autonomous activity lease counts (Idle, Grinding, Trading, LftQueued, BgQueued, PlayerMaster) and lists active lease timers. |

## 5. Mature AI Command Delegation & Whispers

In addition to high-level `.bot action` party commands, you can delegate commands directly to a specific bot either via chat whispers (`/w <BotName> <command>`) or through the `.bot command` CLI proxy:

```text
.bot command <BotName> <command>
# Example: .bot command Dudette trainer
```

## 6. Auction House Management (`.bot ah` / `.ahbot`)

*(GameMaster / Administrator only)*

Manage and monitor the autonomous synthetic Auction House engine in real time:

| Command | Parameters | What It Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `.bot ah status` | None | Displays synthetic AH engine status, inventory size, active listings, and telemetry. |

## ManTech CMaNGOS auction commands

With `AiPlayerbot.AhMarketUseCMaNGOS = 1`, both `.ahbot` and `.bot ah` retain
the CMaNGOS command service: `status [all]`, `reload`, `rebuild [all]`,
and `item <id> [reset|<value> <chance> <min> <max>]`. Use `help` for syntax.
The existing module administrator gate applies before either controller runs.
Rebuilds coalesce and preserve existing bids by default; reload and override
edits are rejected while accepted work is active. Console/SOAP calls continue
through the native command security layer.

ManTech permission detail: `.ahbot` and `.bot ah` require the core's
`SEC_ADMINISTRATOR` by default, with native RBAC/command overrides respected, including authenticated SOAP callers without
a live Player. Ordinary bot commands remain available at player rank subject
to the module's existing ownership checks. Native command registration handles
RBAC, console eligibility and command dispatch before handlers run.
